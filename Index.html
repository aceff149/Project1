    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> I am originally from Texas and made my way to Nashville in 2019.
        I worked in the hotel industry up until COVID which I then was able to
        switch industries to work in the Coworking Industry for the next few 
        years and am now looking at expanding my skill set even further
        by adding Software Engineering. I have two furbabies that are my world.
        Their names are Ryker and Midnight and are my favorite souls to come 
        home to.
    </p>
    <h2> Hobbies</h2>
    <p> I have many hobbies that I enjoy doing. From having my own Custom 
        Merch Company where I make trucker hats, t-shirts, and stickers, to 
        travelling around the world. I love travelling and just recently did
        two weeks in the Mediterrean Sea and Italy area. I cannot wait to explore
        Europe more and enjoy the history and architect.
    </p1>
    <h2> My Goals   
    </h2>
    <p> My goals for the next few years include more international travelling as 
        well as finding out how this new career path can enhance my life. I very 
        much enjoy a work life balance and am striving to attain that goal here in 
        the next few years.
    </p>
